# Farm-Widgets

It's my pleasure to present my first project, which has the potential to be called a software-application.

A basic GUI-based application, which comprises 4 widgets: a Calculator, a To-Do List, a Countdown Timer and a Rock-paper-scissors game; all loaded at one place.
So, let me show you how it works.

Calculator:
I have used a black & white color combination, which gives it an aesthetic look. It can solve pretty much any operation. Also, it is liable to display the answer 
upto 16-decimal precision. Another vital feature is the history feature which shows the last three operations, which were performed and saved.

To-Do List:
Second widget is my favourite. A To-Do List, which helps to keep a track of tasks to be done. It helps to increase productivity. You can also view the tasks that
are already completed.

Timer:
Next is a Countdown Timer. A very simple timer that does exactly what it is intended to do. If you want to stop it, you simply press the reset button.

Rock-Paper-Scissors:
Last but not the least is the amazing Rock, Paper, Scissors game; which is actually a hand game, but I tried to adapt it into a computer game.

Thanks for your interest and attention!!ðŸ™‚

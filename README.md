# Farm-Widgets

A GUI-based application which comprises 4 widgets: a Calculator, a To-Do List, a Countdown Timer and a Rock-paper-scissors game. All loaded at one place.

### Calculator
* Liable to display the answer up to 16-decimal precision.
* It can solve pretty much any operation.
* Another vital feature is the history feature which shows the last three operations, which were performed and saved.
### To-Do List
* Helps to keep a track of tasks to be done.
* Increases productivity. Can also view the tasks that are already completed.
### Timer
* A Countdown Timer that does exactly what it is intended to do. If you want to stop it, you simply press the reset button.
### Rock-Paper-Scissors
* Rock, Paper, Scissors game which is actually a hand game, but I tried to adapt it into a computer game.
